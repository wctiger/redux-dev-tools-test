## Comparing memory/cpu performance difference between using redux dev tools extension and integrating redux dev tools in project.

A simple benchmark - extension reaches 2GB memory usage and frozen at 1m records in the payload.
Integrated version uses 600mb memory and quite performant at 65536 * 1000 records.
